## 🧹 Remove Obsolete handleSubmit Function from PostForm

### Problem
The PostForm component contains an obsolete `handleSubmit` function that has been replaced with Server Actions. This legacy code needs to be removed to clean up the codebase and eliminate potential confusion.

### Plan

#### Tasks
1. **Remove handleSubmit function** (lines 311-437)
   - Large async function that handles form submission manually
   - Contains calls to `setIsSubmitting(true)` and `setIsSubmitting(false)`
   - Uses supabase directly for database operations
   - Has been replaced by Server Actions (`handleFormAction`)

2. **Remove uploadImage function** (lines 291-309) 
   - Function only used by the handleSubmit function
   - Server Actions now handle image uploads
   - Contains supabase storage operations that are duplicated elsewhere

3. **Clean up any remaining references**
   - Verify no other code references the removed functions
   - Check that all imports are still needed after removal

#### Expected Outcome
- PostForm component will be cleaner and use only Server Actions
- No more direct supabase calls in the component
- No more manual submission state management
- Reduced code complexity and better separation of concerns

#### Notes
- The component already uses `useFormState` and `handleFormAction` for Server Actions
- Image handling functions like `handleImageChange`, `removeImage` are preserved
- All form rendering and state management functions are preserved
