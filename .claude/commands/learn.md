# Prime - Load Full Project Context

This command loads comprehensive context about the Community Bulletin Board project to ensure continuity across work sessions.

## Project Overview

**Community Bulletin Board** - A modern web application replacing fragmented Facebook Messenger group chats for neighborhood communities. Provides structured, searchable platform for carpools, food selling, services, and more.

**Target**: Local community members  
**Goal**: Central, organized hub for community services and marketplace  
**Status**: Deployed and functional on Vercel with authentication working

## Current Architecture & Tech Stack

**Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)  
**Authentication**: Facebook OAuth via Supabase Auth  
**Deployment**: Vercel (https://communitybulletinboard.vercel.app)  
**File Storage**: Supabase Storage for post images  

**Key Patterns Used**:
- Server Components with server-side data fetching
- Server Actions for all form handling (useActionState, useFormStatus)
- Zod validation schemas for type safety
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Middleware for authentication protection

### = RECENTLY COMPLETED
- **Authentication Fix**: Resolved Facebook OAuth production issues
- **Environment Variable Cleaning**: Fixed invalid header value errors
- **Infinite Loop Fix**: Resolved React rendering errors
- **Cookie Handling**: Proper session management in production
- **Server Components**: Full migration to App Router patterns

## Database Schema

**Tables**:
- `categories`: Static category definitions with icons and descriptions
- `posts`: User posts with JSON details field for category-specific data
- `profiles`: User profile data (future enhancement)

**Key Features**:
- JSONB `details` field for flexible category-specific data
- RLS policies for user-owned content protection
- Optimized indexes for search performance
- Image storage integration

## Recent Technical Achievements

1. **Complete App Router Migration**: Moved from client-side patterns to modern Server Components
2. **Server Actions Implementation**: All forms now use Server Actions with proper TypeScript typing
3. **Authentication Resolution**: Fixed production OAuth flow with proper cookie handling
4. **Search Enhancement**: Advanced search with real-time results and category awareness
5. **Image Management**: Multiple image uploads with smooth slider interface
6. **Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed on Vercel with all features working

## Current Working State

 **Authentication**: Facebook login working in production  
 **Post Creation**: Full post management with images  
 **Search**: Real-time search across all content  
 **Categories**: All 6 categories functional  
 **Mobile**: Responsive design working  
 **Performance**: Fast loading with optimized queries  

## Project Memory Files Context

**Located in `project_memory/`**:
- `01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`: Core project goals and vision
- `02_FEATURES_ROADMAP.md`: Feature planning (needs updating)
- `03_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`: Database structure documentation
- `04_TECH_STACK_AND_DECISIONS.md`: Technical decisions record

**Documentation Status**: Project memory files are outdated compared to actual progress. Recent major achievements not reflected in roadmap.

## Development Workflow

**Current Process**:
1. Use `@prime` to load context (this command)
2. Plan major changes in `specs/` folder
3. Implement with proper TypeScript and testing
4. Update documentation after completion
5. Deploy to Vercel automatically via git push

**Available Commands** (after full implementation):
- `@prime`: Load full project context
- `@update-roadmap`: Update feature roadmap
- `@create-spec`: Create new planning document

## Ready to Continue Development

You now have complete context of the Community Bulletin Board project. Key points:

=€ **Project is production-ready** with all core features working  
=' **Modern architecture** using latest Next.js patterns  
 **Authentication resolved** and fully functional  
=ñ **User-friendly** with advanced search and image management  
=Ú **Documentation gap** - roadmap needs updating to reflect progress
