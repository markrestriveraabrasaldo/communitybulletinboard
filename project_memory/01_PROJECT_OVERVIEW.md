# Project Overview: Community Bulletin Board

**Project Goal:** To create a dedicated web application that replaces the fragmented Facebook Messenger group chats our community uses for various services. The app will provide a structured, searchable, and trustworthy platform for community members to connect.

**Core Problem:** The current system (multiple Messenger chats) is chaotic, impossible to search, and lacks structure. Important announcements or requests get lost easily.

**Target Audience:** Members of our local community.

**Value Proposition:** A central, organized hub for finding services like food, carpooling, and handyman work, and for buying/selling goods within the community.
